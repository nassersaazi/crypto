Users of the Lightning Network can route payments to each other for low cost and in real time.

Users who exchange value over the Lightning Network do not need to wait for block confirmations for payments.

Once a payment on the Lightning Network has completed, usually within a few seconds, it is final and cannot be reversed. Like a Bitcoin transaction, a payment on the Lightning Network can only be refunded by the recipient.

Whereas on-chain Bitcoin transactions are broadcast and verified by all nodes in the network, payments routed on the Lightning Network are transmitted between pairs of nodes and are not visible to everyone, resulting in much greater privacy.

Unlike transactions on the Bitcoin network, payments routed on the Lightning Network do not need to be stored permanently. Lightning thus uses fewer resources and hence is cheaper. This property also has benefits for privacy.

The Lightning Network uses onion routing, similar to the protocol used by The Onion Router (Tor) privacy network, so that even the nodes involved in routing a payment are only directly aware of their predecessor and successor in the payment route.

When used on top of Bitcoin, the Lightning Network uses real bitcoin, which is always in the possession (custody) and full control of the user. Lightning is not a separate token or coin, it is Bitcoin
