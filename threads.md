-using sequencers to reduce cost and improve scalability by only publishing transaction merkle roots to the blockchain
-without degrading the trust assumptions of the system
-withdrawals can be made by showing merkle proofs instead of checking the actual state of 
 the Ethereum blockchain
-the sequencer provides the merkle proof to the user
-data from the sequencer is stored(but not executed) on the blockchain to ensure it's always available
